        I am a sophomore at <b>Department of Computer Engineering, SVNIT Surat</b>.My major is Computer Engineering but I love to communicate with the people, pitch them about new technologies, making business models and finding ways to improve existing products. <br><br>
‘Move fast and break things’ has always been the principle I followed. That’s why I always look for innovative ways to tackle tasks, which are being assigned to me, with minimum time and maximum efficiency because meeting the deadline is not just enough for me, beating the deadline is what I think of. Moreover, attention to details, team work and discipline is what makes me stand out of the league. I firmly believe in ‘The Early you start, the early you fail and the early you will succeed’ and that is the reason I have significant past work experience. With the past experiences, I have developed the ability to see the things with creative as well as business point of view. These are the crucial things which are required to disrupt an entire industry or creating a breakthrough product. An entrepreneurial mind, punctual and focused one who always adds values wherever he goes – Yes, that’s me for you.
